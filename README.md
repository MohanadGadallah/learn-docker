# Docker Learning Progress

This repository documents my learning journey with Docker, including commonly used commands for managing containers, data, logs, and troubleshooting.

## Building a Docker Image
To build a Docker image from a `Dockerfile`:
```sh
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .
```
Example:
```sh
docker build -t flask_app:1.0 .
```

## Setting Environment Variables in Docker Build
To set environment variables in a `Dockerfile`, use the `ENV` instruction:
```dockerfile
ENV APP_ENV=production
ENV DEBUG=False
```
Alternatively, you can pass environment variables at build time using `--build-arg`:
```sh
docker build --build-arg APP_ENV=production -t flask_app:1.0 .
```
To use `ARG` in a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
ARG APP_ENV=development
ENV APP_ENV=$APP_ENV
```

## Creating and Managing Docker Volumes
To create a named volume:
```sh
docker volume create <volume_name>
```
To list all volumes:
```sh
docker volume ls
```
To inspect a volume:
```sh
docker volume inspect <volume_name>
```
To remove a volume:
```sh
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```

## Managing Data for Containers
To run a container with a volume mount and expose a port:
```sh
docker run -it -v <host_absolute_path>:<folder_path_in_container> -p 5000:5000 flask_app:1.0
```

## Accessing Running Containers
To get back into a running container:
```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```
If the container is running in daemon mode (background), list all running containers:
```sh
docker ps
```

## Accessing Docker Logs
To view logs of a specific container:
```sh
docker logs <container_id>
```
To save logs to a file:
```sh
docker logs <container_id> > output.log
```
To watch real-time logs:
```sh
docker logs -f <container_id>
```

## Attaching to a Running Container
To attach to a running container:
```sh
docker attach <container_id>
```
âš  **Warning:** Attaching to a container means sharing its standard input/output. If you press `Ctrl+C`, it will stop the container. To safely detach without stopping it, use `Ctrl+P + Ctrl+Q`.

## Troubleshooting
For diagnosing issues using the terminal or Docker Desktop, refer to:
[Docker Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/troubleshoot/)

## Managing Docker Space
To check how much space Docker is using:
```sh
docker system df
```
To remove all unused data:
```sh
docker system prune
```
To clean specific elements:
```sh
docker container prune  # Remove stopped containers
docker image prune      # Remove unused images
docker network prune    # Remove unused networks
```

## Inspecting Containers
To inspect a container, image, or network:
```sh
docker inspect <container_id | image_id | network_id>
```

## Working with Docker Hub
### Pushing an Image to Docker Hub
1. Log in to Docker Hub:
   ```sh
   docker login
   ```
   Enter your Docker Hub credentials.

2. Push an image:
   ```sh
   docker push <username>/flask_app:1.0
   ```

### Pulling an Image from Docker Hub
To download an image from Docker Hub:
```sh
docker pull <username>/flask_app:1.0
```

## Docker Networks
### Network Terminologies and Commands
Some key network terminologies:
- **Hostname:** The name of a machine used to identify it in a network.
- **Ping:** Use `ping <hostname>/<ip>` to check machine connectivity.
- **Subnet:** A smaller, isolated part of a network, creating boundaries within the same network.
- **DNS:** A directory that maps reachable hosts using IP and hostname, allowing access by either.
- **/etc/hosts:** A file containing all reachable hosts with their IP addresses.

### Docker Communication
![Docker Communication](./docker_communication.png)


Docker network types#

By default, Docker creates three networks.

Run the docker network ls command like so:

The none and host networks cannot be removed, theyâ€™re part of the network stack in Docker, but not useful to network administrators since they have no external interfaces to configure.

Admins can configure the bridge network, also known as the Docker0 network. This network automatically creates an IP subnet and gateway.

All containers that belong to this network are part of the same subnet, so communication between containers in this network can occur via IP addressing.

A drawback of the default bridge network is that automatic service discovery of containers using DNS is not supported. Therefore, if you want containers that belong to the default network to be able to talk to each other, you must use the --link option to statically allow communications to occur. Additionally, communication requires port forwarding between containers.

This `README.md` will be updated as I progress in learning Docker. ðŸš€
